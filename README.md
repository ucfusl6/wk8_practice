Question: 

8.6.2 Key advice
Here, we look to see if either the standard tests LMerr or LMlag are significant (p <0.05), if one is then that is our answer. If both are move to the robust tests and apply the same rule.

If everything is significant then Prof Anselin (2008) proposed:

    One robust test will often be much more significant than the other. In which select the most significant model.

    In the case both a highly significant select the largest test statistic value - but here, there may be violations of the regression assumptions

Here, based on this test and guidance which is the right model to select? ==> What do you mean?
